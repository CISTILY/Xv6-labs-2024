1. Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
Answer: usertrap () function at kernel/trap.c called syscall

2. What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
Answer: The value of p->trapframe->a7 is 7 and it represent for SYS_exec which can be seen from kernel/syscall.h 

3. What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
Answer: user mode 

4. Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable num?
Answer: the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at
        80002052:	    00002683          	lw	a3,0(zero) # 0 <_entry-0x80000000>
        register corresponds to the variable num is a3 

5. Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? 
Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? 
Answer: The kernel crash because of an error occurred while loading data from memory address 0 into s2. From the course textbook, 
        address 0 does not map to the kernel space, it begins at virtual address 0x80000000.

6. What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
Answer: name = "initcode\000\000\000\000\000\000\000"
        pid = 1
